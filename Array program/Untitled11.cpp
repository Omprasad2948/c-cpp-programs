//with the same function that prints "Polygon is a shape". Create two other classes named Rectangle and Triangle having the same function 
//which prints "Rectangle is a polygon" and "Triangle is a polygon" respectively. Again, make another class named Square having the same function 
//which prints "Square is a rectangle".
//Now, try calling the function by the object of each of these classes.
